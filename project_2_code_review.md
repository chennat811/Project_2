## Clean Code:

- Code follows PEP-8
- Very readable and easy to follow 
- Excellent job organizing folders for data sets and 
- Great job using python functions & including docstrings. (E.g fucntion "distributor")
  Love the efficient function to collect and clean data and create dataframe all in one. 
  In future projects these can be moved to separate .py modules and imported.

  
## Good Documentation:

- Good & informative README.md
- In your README.md, good job providing a clear scope and analysis, methodology, data science methods used, and summary of your findings. In future projects
  create headings for those sub topics. E.g.( have a bolded results section then place your results in the section). 
  This way its easier for the reader to find information
- Markdown cell at beginning of .ipynb to explains scope and analyis
- Inline code comments were thorough and consistent


## Proper Data Science:


- Great modeling workflow. The succession of working through a baseline model, log transfom, poly features, and feature selection was very good. 
- **Scaling features** , reminder to fit_transform only on the training set & transform on the validation and/or testing set
- Code demonstrates good Linear Regression understanding. Great thought process to try modeling with regularization. (Good job performing both LR and Lasso)
- Great job knowing to log transform features to improve model
- Good visualizations -- not too much info, clear and interpretable. Love the busiest stations highlighted in orange on gray, very effective way to highlight relevant info.

## Comments:

- Good job on project 2! :)
- Love the approach/project design. Very clear and concise. Clearly shows you understand how to take model results and make improvements
- Good visualizations and analysis
- Looking forward to your growth in project 3. Keep it going!!
